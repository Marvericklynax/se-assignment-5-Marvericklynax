How to Open and Use the Integrated Terminal in VS Code
Opening the Integrated Terminal
Using the Menu:
Go to View > Terminal.
Using the Keyboard Shortcut:
Press Ctrl+Alt+T
Using the Integrated Terminal
Creating New Terminals:
Click the + icon in the terminal panel to open a new terminal instance.
Switching Between Terminals:
Use the dropdown menu in the terminal panel to switch between multiple terminal instances.
Splitting Terminals:
Click the split terminal icon in the terminal panel to create a side-by-side terminal.

Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal Compared to an External Terminal
Seamless Integration:
The integrated terminal allows you to run commands and see the output directly within VS Code, eliminating the need to switch between the editor and an external terminal. This streamlines the workflow and saves time.
Project Context:
The integrated terminal opens in the context of your workspace, so you don’t need to navigate to the project directory manually. This ensures that your commands are always executed in the right context.
Multi-terminal Support:
You can open multiple terminal instances and split them within the same window, which is especially useful for running different processes simultaneously (e.g., a development server, build process, and testing).
Persistent Sessions:
Terminal sessions can be persistent across VS Code sessions, so you don’t lose your terminal state when you close and reopen VS Code.
Integrated Output Panel:
Having the terminal integrated means you can easily refer to the code while viewing terminal output. This is particularly helpful when debugging or running tests, as you can see both your code and the terminal output side by side.
